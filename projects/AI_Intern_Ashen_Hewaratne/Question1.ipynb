    "There is only one chef in the kitchen, he is only capable of processing one order at a given time. chef will use prepare_next_order function to get the next order that available in the system. Calling prepare_next_order function will return table_id, waiter_id and meal_id to the chef.\n",

    "There is another function called check_status to check what is the status of the order, after providing table_number this function will provide status of the order. If it is already taken by the chef using prepare_next_order function then status will be preparing. Or otherwise it is still in the queue structure. It will provide what is the location of the order in queue. \n",
